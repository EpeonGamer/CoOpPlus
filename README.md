Minecraft tweaks to promote better cooperative experiences.

## As of writing includes:
### Datapacks:
- ShieldBuddy (standing close to other players with colored shields gives helpful status effects; mod that shows status effects with invisible particles helps).

## Recommended mods (not required):
- Simple Voice Chat (or other (proximity) voice chat mods; enhances player interaction)
- TPA++ (or other inter-player teleport fucntionality to promote cohesion; preferably disable "/back" (self promotion of Team Respawn datapack: [Scatter-Team-Respawn](https://github.com/EpeonGamer/Scatter-Team-Respawn)))
- Waystones/Home system (unless vanilla-friendly transport is preferred)
- Immersive Melodies (or another instrument mod, enhances moments together)
- Lenient Death (configureable death inventory loss; use if some players require mercy)
- Lootr (unique inventory loot per player, so exploration is not hampered by others as much)
